# generator-primavera [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]
> Utility generators for the primavera framework.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-primavera using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-primavera
npm install -g babel-cli
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo primavera
```

## Subgenerators

Now that you already have a working project (really, try npm start! ;)), try adding some services, components and endpoints to it.


```bash
yo primavera:endpoint
```

There are 4 subgenerators available at the moment:
 * component
 * service
 * middleware
 * endpoint
 
This is also the loading order (you can play with it in src/app.js).
If it doesn't make sense for you, just change it.


## Enabling HTTPS

The bootstrap file (src/app.js) is already checking for key.pem and cert.pem.
If you need to run HTTPS locally, then just generate the keys with ssh


```bash
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -key key.pem -out cert.pem -days 3650
```

Next time you `npm start`, the HTTPS server will listen on port 3443.
